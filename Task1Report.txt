A brief report on simple statistics of G1 and G2:

G1:

G1 is a graph generated based on the 1000 URLs obtained from running a BFS crawler.
This Graph consists of DOC Ids of each page crawled (key) and DOC Ids of incoming links of that page (values).

Size of the corpus (pages) = 1000
No. of Pages with no in-links (sources) = 0
Proportion of pages with no in-links = 0
No. of Pages with no out-links (sinks) = 331
Proportion of pages with no out-links = 331/1000


G2:

G2 is a graph generated based on the 1000 URLs obtained from running a DFS crawler.
This Graph consists of DOC Ids of each page crawled (key) and DOC Ids of incoming links of that page (values).

Size of the corpus (pages) = 1000
No. of Pages with no in-links (sources) = 0
Proportion of pages with no in-links = 0
No. of Pages with no out-links (sinks) = 188
Proportion of pages with no out-links = 188/1000
