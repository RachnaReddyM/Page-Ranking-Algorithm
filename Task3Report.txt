Few pages like "tropical_cyclone", "integrated_authority_file", "international_standard_book_number", "tornado" , "national_diet_library" , "meteorology" 
among the top 10 pages have high Page Rank and have high number of incoming links. These are the kind of pages which have good quality incoming links 
because of which their page rank is high as well.
Though few pages like "cyclone" , "extratropical_cyclone", "thunderstorm" and "storm_surge" have high number of in-links, 
their page ranks are still very low as their incoming links are not popular enough on the web, to have a higher rank.

Similarly, there are also pages with high page rank, but do not have high number of incoming links as it depends on the popularity/quality of incoming links. 
Even though they have lesser incoming links than other pages, their incoming links might have higher page rank.
The Page Rank of incoming links also plays a role in determining the Page Rank of a particular page.
